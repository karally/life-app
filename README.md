A personal habit tracker and life organizer. Yeah, personal.

## Getting Started

This project is a Flutter application. What's flutter? Use Google. They built it anyways.

Essentially I'm totally just copying the ideas of a dozen apps into one with my personal preferences. Well, merits of being a developer I guess. Also good practice on flutter to show off to people, so why not?
